# Scam Site Filter

This project aims to automate the process of identifying and filtering scam crypto airdrop links shared on Twitter. It involves monitoring tweets that mention "@addtofilter," extracting relevant information, checking the redirection of links, and creating a list of verified scam site URLs. The list can then be used with ad-blocking tools like uBlock to protect users from accessing scam sites.
